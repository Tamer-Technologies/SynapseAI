This repository hosts the complete, static frontend design for an AI chat application, SynapseAI.
This project is a proof-of-concept built entirely on a design specification, demonstrating a modular, high-fidelity user interface (UI) without including any live backend or AI processing logic.

## 💡 Development Methodology

This application was developed using a reverse-engineering approach, where the design was implemented based on visual observation. This methodology allowed for a rigorous focus on:

- **Complex Component Architecture**: Breaking down an intricate, custom design into reusable, maintainable React components (e.g., Carousel.jsx, ButtonVariant.jsx).
- **SVG and Asset Manipulation**: Extensive use of professional design tools (Figma, Photoshop) to create, refine, and integrate unique graphical assets, SVGs, and dynamic image layers into the codebase.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Mastering advanced CSS techniques and custom Tailwind utilities for complex animations, gradients, and interactive effects like mouse-parallax (useMouseParallex.js).

## 🎨 Design & Asset Workflow

The visual assets and UI elements were created through a multi-step process:

- **Generative AI**: Used to create base imagery for high-resolution component backgrounds and visual concepts.
- **Professional Enhancement**: Images were refined and layered in Adobe Photoshop to achieve the dark-mode aesthetic and visual depth.
- **Figma to Code**: UI icons and decorative elements were designed in Figma, with their SVG code directly integrated into the components for maximum control over animations and dynamic styling.

## 🚀 Key Frontend Features

- **Data-Driven Structure**: All text content is centralized in JavaScript constants (index.js) for easy management.
- **Interactive UI**: Features mouse-parallax effects (useMouseParallex.js) and complex component interactions (e.g., color-changing feature cards, collaboration wheel animation).
- **Utility Focus**: Includes custom JavaScript utility functions for data fetching and text formatting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Custom Config)
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Photoshop, Generative AI
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
